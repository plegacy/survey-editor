# Survey Editor

The single-page application contains one page with inline editing capabilities of a survey question title and a list of answers.
The survey editing capabilities are as follows:
- Allow editing the question's title and answers
- Allow to add new answers using the answer placeholder component and remove existing answers, using the delete button.
- A new answer must contain a title and an image

The project includes a setup for running a local web server using `http-server`.
